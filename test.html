				<div class="text">Lumbar puncture (or lumbar tap) is a diagnostic procedure used to collect CSF and measure intercranial pressure. The procedure as it’s done today consists of sticking a needle into the patient’s spine, attaching a glass manometer to the needle, then letting CSF drip out the end of the needle into a jar! Sounds painful, right? My team and I decided that there must be a better way to do this, and so the EZ-Tap Lumbar Puncture Device was born. Our product combines the entire procedure into one compact device, making it much simpler and faster (and less scary) to complete the three main goals of lumbar punctures: (1) detect when the current location has been reached by the needle tip, (2) measure the patient’s intracranial pressure, and (3) collect CSF. Don’t know what any of these words mean, or want to learn more about our design process? Click for more info!</div>
